Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming? 
I think encapsulation makes it a lot easier to tell what variables belong to what class, so when structuring my code, I think it made it a lot more simple. It also makes it clear which classes should be able to take which actions, as a class shouldn't be able to edit an object that isn't declared within that class. However, if the object needs to be altered, that means the class that does have the object should have a method that allows it to be altered. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 

Because there were several files that used methods from each other, I didn't initally test my code until I was done with all of it, which was not the brightest idea. It ended up mostly working out, but I realized going back it was absolutely possible to test my code as I went. I also struggled for a while printing the manifest with names instead of the object location, but luckily someone in slack already had the same question and someone else had answered it. So, advice I would give is to talk to classmates / look at Slack, because I feel that often people have the same struggles!
